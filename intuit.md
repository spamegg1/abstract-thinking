# Intuition and intuitive thinking

What is intuition? How do we even define it?

## Common views on intuition

There are a few commonly held views about intuition.

### Intuition is Instinctive

- This has both good and bad connotations.
- Some people believe that you are simply born with intuition, or not.

### Intuition is Familiarity

- One commonly known aspect of intuition is to be familiar with something.
  - When we are familiar with, say X, our brains don't have to work so hard.
  - So, it feels like X is "intuitive" or was designed to be intuitive.
  - Then, if we encounter Y, which is different than X,
  it feels "un-intuitive" or badly designed.

#### Example

- Many users of Microsoft Windows say that the GUI (graphical user interface)
is very intuitive; like it was designed based on universal human perception.
- But this is simply a fallacy; the reason is that the users had so many years
of using Windows, ***so their minds are familiar with it***.
- In fact this is true in general.
  - Some Mac users who have to use Windows will claim that Windows is "un-intuitive".
  - Same goes for long time Adobe Photoshop users who try to use GIMP,
  - and so on...
- There is generally no way to come up with a universally obvious thing.
- Our minds strongly prefer what's familiar, and reject the unfamiliar.
  - And this depends on many things: life experience, culture, geography...

##### Details

- Microsoft did conduct some user research and
[case studies](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/238386.238611),
  - but that's not the point.
- They used the already familiar "office desk" metaphor for the GUI.
- People had decades of familiarity with office desks, files, folders, cabinets.
  - Younger generations that grew up in the digital world are now
  struggling with this old metaphor. It is unfamiliar to them.
  - [Read here](https://www.theverge.com/22684730/students-file-folder-directory-structure-education-gen-z)
- Many users still struggled with the Windows 95 GUI at the beginning.
- For example, here are two excerpts from the case study:
  > Beginning users and many intermediates were confused
  by the two-pane view of File Cabinet. (See Figure 3.)
  They were unsure of the relationship between the panes
  and how to navigate between folders.
- Even experienced users *already familiar with the GUI* were confused:
  > Users of every type were confused by the Programs folder.
  We thought that having a folder on the desktop with other folders and
  links to programs inside it would be a natural transition for Windows 3.1
  users accustomed to Program Manager,
  while being relatively easy to learn for beginners. We were wrong!

#### The unfamiliar is scary

- Our instincts make us run away from unfamiliar things, as they might be dangerous.
- This has far reaching consequences like discrimination, nepotism, conflict, war, etc.

#### The unfamiliar is expensive

- The human brain burns a lot of calories,
- and takes years to accept certain things as fact or reality.
  - That is a lot of calorie investment! Like raising a child.
- The shortcut of familiarity is not just mental, it's also economical.
- So, rewiring the brain is very costly, purely from an economic perspective.
- Re-learning or un-learning is quite a time and calorie investment,
  - with uncertain payoffs...

#### An example

- When users want to switch operating systems, say going from Windows to Linux,
the most difficult part is often...
  - **not** how to get things done with new and different software,
    - as there is usually the same app, or a good substitute that can get the job done;
  - but the *learning* involved, and adapting to new unfamiliar things.
- Because it is quite an investment to re-learn,
  - people expect the payoff to be very high:
  - *Linux should be just like Windows, but better.*

### Intuition is Speed & Repetition

- One method often mentioned to develop your math / CS intuition is to:
  - *keep repeating it* (solve problems, then solve more problems, etc.)
    - until the patterns become clear, and second nature,
    - so your mind can "see" them subconsciously,
  - and to keep [reading hundreds of solutions](https://youtu.be/1f6N2UrCK6o?t=475),
    - even if you are not coming up with any of the ideas yourself!
  - So you create a mapping between general problem parts and solution parts.
  - So you can recognize them and solve very quickly! *SPEED!*
    - Good for passing tests, winning competitions, etc.
- This focuses on pattern recognition speed by relying on familiarity (above),
  - but not necessarily the right approach for long-term, deep understanding.

### Intuition is Insight

- Another commonly held view of intuition is to have *insight*.
- Insight is that clever, magical creative leap, like pulling a rabbit out of a hat.
  - Coming up with a novel idea, which was not in the problem,
  - or was not even in the standard solution methods or known techniques.

## Developing your intuition

### How to develop your insight

- Try to [invent the solution](https://youtu.be/Dm68uFy6gus?t=436),
  - even if you have no idea, and it's completely new to you.

#### Get insight from others

- Many others before us had insights, which they passed down to us.
- These are ideas, ways to attack a problem that go beyond the normal standard
techniques or procedures.
  - Example: ???

#### Look beneath the surface, and "mine" for insightful ideas

- When you come up with a solution yourself, or read someone else's solution,
  - look for deeper ideas that were part of it,
  - how the ideas can be generalized, transformed, applied to other things.
